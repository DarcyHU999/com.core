# Project scoping
## (A) Vision Statement: 
Our goal is to create an online data pre-processing platform that is feature-rich and simple to use, allowing users to filter and visualize complex data without any coding skills. With the platform's powerful analysis capabilities and rich visualization pages, users can effectively check the integrity and reliability of data.
## (B) General Goals: 
1	Build a simple, friendly query search interface with one-click operation
2	Presenting users with clear and beautiful visual charts and graphs, with details briefly
3	Get generalized content descriptions without extensive data browsing
4	Help users check the integrity and validity of data, saving effort and worry
5	Establish a more beautiful interface, human-computer interaction more convenient query system, so that users are more comfortable to use (prompt the most used topics)
6	Add a rating area, and each user can rate the information returned by the system
## (C) Group/Team Goals: 
The front-end display team (Zhihao Wang, Yanjun Mu)
1	Simplify the user search process (implement drop-down boxes and fuzzy search)
2	Optimize the user's reading experience when extracting data (page aesthetics + visualization components)
The back-end design team (Kairui Jin, Chang Wang, Qingyuan Hu)
3	Design effective methods to assess the integrity and reliability of the data
4	Coordinate with the front-end display team to achieve seamless interaction between the front and back ends.
5	Implement persistent storage of user information.

# Project features
## 1.Search keyword and select interface
As a data analyst, I can search key words to filter data and deal with excess data. And I can select interface that I want to explore. I input the keywords that most closely match the research area of my project. I am on search bar interface, I input my key words, select interface, and click search button, then it jumps to another page of showing the summary of selected interface.
## 2.Keyword History Record
As a data analyst, the keywords I want to search for may have different expressions, such as: safety and safety. I may need to search back and forth for two keywords to compare the returned results. At this time, if there is a keyword history record, it can save me the time of retyping that may spend me 2 or 3 seconds, which will greatly improve my work efficiency.
## 3.Show summary of interface
As a programmer, I can effectively find some useful and suitable interfaces which can support the data volume of the entire project. For example, I want to find an interface which have specific weather forecast information in Sydney or I want to have the latest information on the current exchange rates of various countries. By reading those visualization content, I have the potential to find an interface that meets their requirements within 3 minutes.
## 4.Download Raw Data
As a data analyst, in addition to showing the summary of the interface and the reasons for selection at the company's meeting, due to the requirements of some companies to back up and archive the files used, I need to provide the source file of the data returned by the interface. So, if there is a button to download the source file with one click, I will get the source file in a second. Obviously, this saves me more time than getting the source files myself. 
## 5.Scoring System
As a data analyst or a programmer looking for interfaces, when I wander between multiple interfaces and it is difficult to find the most suitable one from these interfaces, I would like to see which interfaces are highly rated by my peers. When the scoring system shows me the scores of previous users, within 5 seconds, I can choose the interface with a better equal score from the interfaces that I felt difficult to choose before.
